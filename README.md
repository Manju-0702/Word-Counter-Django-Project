# Word-Counter-Django-Project
The Word Counter Django Project is a web app built with Django to analyze text input. It counts the number of words, letters, vowels, consonants, and articles ('a', 'an', 'the'). After submitting text, users see detailed statistics in an easy-to-read format. This project is perfect for basic text analysis tasks.
